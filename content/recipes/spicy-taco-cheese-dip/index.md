I always requests for the recipe on this one. You can turn up the heat as much as you like by adjusting the jalapeños and the types of Rotel you use.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef (I like to use about 1.25)
- 1 yellow onion, finely diced
- 1 large (or 2 small) jalapeños, seeded and finely minced
- 2/3 cup water
- Taco seasoning mix (use packaging instructions for how much)
- 2 32 ounces Velveeta cheese, cut into cubes
- 2 (10-ounce) cans Rotel

## Directions

1. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink. Drain. Add the jalapeños, water and taco seasoning, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat.
2. In a 4 to 6-quart slow cooker, add the prepared beef mixture, the Velveeta cheese and the cans of Rotel. Stir well and cook on low until the cheese is completely melted, 1 to 2 hours. Keep the slow cooker set warm to serve during a party, giving the mixture a good stir before serving.

## Notes

I typically use 1 hot and 1 original cans of Rotel.
