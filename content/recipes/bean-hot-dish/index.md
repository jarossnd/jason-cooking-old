A bean hot dish from my Grandmother. I like to call them the lake beans since we always ate them at the lakes in Minnesota.

## Ingredients

1/2 lb. Ground beef
1/2 lb. Bacon
1 medium onion
1 can baked beans
1 can kidney beans, drained
1 can pork & beans
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 tea. Mustard
1 tea. Vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar

## Directions

1. Brown hamburger and drain
2. Cut bacon into small slices
3. Add all ingredients to crock pot
3. Cook in crock pot for several hours

# Notes

- Sometimes I will lightly fry bacon prior to putting in crock pot so it gets done sooner.
